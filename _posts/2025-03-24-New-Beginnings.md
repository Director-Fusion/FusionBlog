Hello, I’m Cory Keller, the founder and CEO of our Fusion Cyber Security MDR. I’ve spent my career in roles such as Penetration Tester, Incident Response Analyst, and Security Engineer. These experiences have taken me to some incredible places, both literally and professionally, and I’ve been fortunate to learn a great deal from real-world challenges and talented peers along the way.

This blog marks a fresh start. While I’ve written before, past content has been lost, and rather than dwell on that, I see it as an opportunity to build something better. This space will be a mix of technical insights, lessons learned, and reflections on the evolving world of cybersecurity. It’s a place for continuous learning, for myself, for our team, and for anyone looking to grow their understanding of this field.

We won’t be chasing headlines or trying to keep up with every piece of cybersecurity news. Unless we’re directly involved in something making waves, we’ll leave news coverage to the media. Our focus is on sharing knowledge grounded in experience, the kind of content that adds real value.

Recently, I’ve also been diving into Machine Learning. It’s proving to be a powerful tool in the cybersecurity toolbox, and the learning curve has been both steep and rewarding. I look forward to sharing more about that journey, including how we’re applying ML to improve our security posture and better protect our clients.

Thank you for stopping by. Whether you're a fellow practitioner, a small business owner, or someone simply curious about cybersecurity, we’re glad you’re here.

Check out my most recent research contributions. It ain't much but it is honest work. [SANS Technology Institute Research Paper][sans-research]
